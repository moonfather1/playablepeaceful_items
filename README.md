This mod is a part of a triad of mods.

**Playable peaceful - Core** (curseforge, modrinth) disables auto-heal and makes hunger behave like in other difficulty modes.
 - You wanted a vast barley field but it didn't make sense in peaceful mode until now? Problem solved.
 - You can no longer ignore fall damage, drowning damage etc. You need to be careful now.
 - Craft that cooking pot and enjoy your meals. Seriously, do that because you can actually die of starvation (though it's hard to imagine that anyone will).

**Playable peaceful - Items**  (curseforge, modrinth) provides ways to get things that usually come from mobs while playing in peaceful mode.
 - Farm cotton in your garden and make string from it. 
 - Make a slime pen and fill it with cute little slimes.

 - etc.

**Playable peaceful - XP**  (curseforge, modrinth) gives you xp for various tasks you do in peaceful difficulty.
 * Trying new food gives a bit of xp.
 * Moving in various ways (mounts/vehicles/gliders) gives XP in a few milestones.
 * etc.
